The file contains four simple python functions: the first (Ngap_position_count) counts the number of gaps or Ns in every position of 
a multiple sequence alignment in fasta format; the second (save_as_df) saves the result as a data frame in a tsv file; the third 
(plot_Ngap_counts) plots the results and save the plot in pdf, png or svg, the fourth (cut_alignment) trims the sequences in the 
alignment by input positions and the fifth (first_last_alignment_positions) to generate a tsv file with the first and last base pair (i.e. non gaps) for each record in the sequence alignment.
